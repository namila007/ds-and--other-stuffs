here factory patter is implemented in 3 ways;
1. Factory - factory as an object and it's simple
2. Method -  Defines an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
3. Abstract - Abstract Factory offers the interface for creating a family of related objects, without explicitly specifying their classes
